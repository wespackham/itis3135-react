                I am a Junior currently pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science with a concentration in Web/Mobile
                Development and Software Engineering. I am also working towards a minor in mathematics and am a part of
                the CCI Honors Program. I work as the Arts & Culture editor for the student newspaper, the Niner Times.
                In my free time I enjoy thrifting, skating, playing guitar and photography.
