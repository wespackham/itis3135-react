                    I, Wes Packham, agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my FALL 2025, ITIS3135, Web
                    Development course with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen. I understand that all work I do on
                    publicly available online tools will be available to the world, and I will not put information there
                    that is inappropriate for schoolwork or that I wish to keep private. I understand that my work counts
                    for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. I understand that it is possible to find examples
                    online or view classmates' code, but I will only use these resources to learn and will not copy code
                    except where I give proper credit (e.g., external libraries).
                    <br /><br />
